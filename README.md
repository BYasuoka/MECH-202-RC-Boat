# MECH-202-RC-Boat
This repository is filled with the code and photos of my RC Boat using Arduino IDE, DC Electronic Speed Controllers, Servos, and more.

In the semester of FA23, I was enrolled in a MECH 202 Course at Colorado State University. In this course we were tasked to design and engineer a prototype to a Remote Controlled boat. Some basic specifics for this boat were
 - It needed to be 14"x20" with no height limit
 - Two Barbies needed to sit comfortably on the Boat
The purpose of this project was for at the end of the semester there would be a Barbie Battle Boat competition. The way to win the competition is below. 
 - Knock both barbies off the boat
 - If one barbie is maimed
 - The opposing boat's international load line is below water for more than 30 seconds
 - The opposing boat is stuck/held against the wall of the pool for more than 30 seconds
